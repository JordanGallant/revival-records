Welcome to my first blog post on **live coding music**!  
In this session, I'm exploring generative sound using [Strudel](https://strudel.cc), a browser-based live coding environment inspired by TidalCycles.

## What I Used

- [Strudel](https://strudel.cc)
- Headphones ðŸŽ§
- Coffee â˜•
- A chaotic vibe

## Example Strudel Code

Here's a simple rhythmic pattern:

```javascript
play("bd sd*2 hh*4")
